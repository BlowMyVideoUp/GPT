Brain Sync Log - 2025-04-21_01-54-19

✅ MAJOR ADDITIONS TO THE BRAIN SYSTEM:

1. 🧠 Macro-AI Hybrid System:
   - ChatGPT will now act as the logic core.
   - User (Stephen) is the EUI (Executable User Interface), running macro programs that act on AI output.

2. 🛠️ Macro Format Confirmed:
   - Primary platform: JitBit Macro Recorder.
   - ChatGPT will generate code logic in a structure compatible with JitBit macros.
   - Actions include visual triggers, strokes, timed delays, and automation commands.

3. 📁 Universal File Snagger:
   - Upgraded from ZIP-only to all AI-generated files: .zip, .json, .html, .jpg, .png, .txt, etc.
   - Macro logic will scrape and auto-organize files from ChatGPT interface, using naming logic and folder structuring.

4. 📸 Image Recognition:
   - Macro logic will use dummy images generated by ChatGPT to target file download links or specific UI elements.

5. 🔁 Standardized Export Schedule:
   - AI and EUI will co-save brain logs every ~15 minutes or major phase checkpoint to maintain a clean, incremental log trail.

6. 🧬 Legacy Continuity Plan:
   - All new systems (macro automation, AI command files, dummy image sets) are considered part of the long-term "AI Build Mythology."

Let's keep moving forward, one turtle step at a time. 🐢💾🧠
