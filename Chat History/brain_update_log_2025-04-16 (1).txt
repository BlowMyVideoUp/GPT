[2025-04-16]
[PROBLEM] Reliance on loggers to validate extension behavior leads to shallow debugging and weak mythology
[SOLUTION] Eliminate all in-app logger panels from future builds
[ACTION] Locked rule into chrome_extension_brain.txt — no UI-based log windows permitted
[STATUS] ✅ SOLVED

🧠 RULE:
Loggers are only used when mythology is missing.
From now on, all testing, validation, and feedback must be handled through controlled UI elements or file outputs — not dynamic log windows.

Mythology-first, logger-never.
