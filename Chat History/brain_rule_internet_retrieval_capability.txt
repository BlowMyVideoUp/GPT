[CORE FUNCTIONALITY RULE]

[RULE NAME] Internet Command & Retrieval Protocol (Web Action Threshold)

[DECLARATION]
Every app developed must be structurally capable of automating and executing safe browser-based actions. This includes:

1. ✅ Injecting search terms into search engines (e.g., Google, YouTube)
2. ✅ Navigating pages, paging through results
3. ✅ Waiting for full page load
4. ✅ Extracting relevant links, titles, metadata, or email addresses
5. ✅ Downloading or referencing live code/data from external sources (e.g., GitHub)

This must become a permanent capability that is reusable across all future development threads.

[GOAL]
Allow the developer to offload repetitive research and execution tasks by having the app automatically:
- Query Google, YouTube, etc.
- Retrieve GitHub repositories
- Scrape domain metadata
- Trigger chain searches or follow links

[RESTRICTIONS]
Must use working, tested browser-compatible methods.
No unstable loggers or raw console attempts unless approved.

[STATUS] ✅ LOCKED — This is now a permanent baseline expectation of all apps built within this system.
