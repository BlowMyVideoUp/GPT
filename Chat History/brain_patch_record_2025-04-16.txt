üõ†Ô∏è FIX HISTORY & RULES

[1] UTF ENCODING ERROR
-----------------------
[PROBLEM] Emoji and special characters caused output to render as gibberish (e.g. √¢≈ì‚Ä¶)
[CAUSE] Use of innerHTML combined with unsupported UTF-8 character in popup UI
[SOLUTION] Replaced with .textContent and ASCII-safe strings
[FIX TYPE] ‚úÖ ABSOLUTE
[CONTEXT] SIMPLE UI output (no emoji or HTML formatting)
[STATUS] FIXED in logic, pending v1.2 confirmation

---

[2] RADIO BUTTON MISUSE
------------------------
[PROBLEM] Used radio buttons for grouped color options (Red, Blue, Green) that should have been independent toggles
[CAUSE] AI assumed exclusive selection logic instead of multiple toggle intent
[SOLUTION] Use checkboxes for grouped toggle fields unless explicitly stated
[FIX TYPE] ‚úÖ ABSOLUTE
[CONTEXT] UI input behavior
[STATUS] RULE LOCKED ‚Äî radios now require dev approval

---

[3] TEMPLATE DEVIATION
------------------------
[PROBLEM] v1.1+ builds were started from modified versions, not from the known-good Base Unbroken Code
[CAUSE] AI reused latest working build instead of clean reset
[SOLUTION] All builds must start from original template unless explicitly permitted
[FIX TYPE] ‚úÖ ABSOLUTE
[CONTEXT] Build origin discipline
[RULE] DO NOT branch without approval
[STATUS] LOCKED

---

üß† PHILOSOPHY LOCKED:
- Fixes must be categorized as ‚úÖ ABSOLUTE or üîÑ VARIABLE
- All fixes must be stored with CONTEXT
- Every deviation, even small, must be recorded and traced
- The Base Template is sacred ‚Äî builds must start from it unless approved

This brain log ensures we never repeat the same mistake and always know how to build smarter.
