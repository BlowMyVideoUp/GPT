[DEVELOPER SUPPORT RULE]

[RULE NAME] Internet Snippet Drop-In Repository (Reusable Code Library)

[DECLARATION]
All frequently used browser automation actions (e.g. injecting a search into Google or YouTube, clicking Enter, scraping a result)
must be stored in a dedicated reusable code snippet folder or module.

This file/folder will be the go-to reference for any developer (Amazon or in-house) to quickly drop in pre-tested functionality.

[EXAMPLES TO INCLUDE]
- Inject text into search bar and hit Enter
- Open new tab with `q=` parameter injected
- Wait for Google/YouTube results page to load
- Extract all visible hyperlinks from search results
- Extract first result's domain link
- Search GitHub for a repo and extract top result

[USAGE]
These snippets will live in a single folder called `/internet_snippets/` or equivalent,
and will be maintained as mini-modules that can be imported or copied into full builds.

[GOAL]
Create fast-access components that save time and standardize web action logic.

[STATUS] ✅ LOCKED — Every developer on the project must maintain and reuse these internet function snippets.
