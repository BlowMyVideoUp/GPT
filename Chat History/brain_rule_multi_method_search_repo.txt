[WEB AUTOMATION STRATEGY RULE]

[RULE NAME] Internal Multi-Method Search Injection Repository

[DECLARATION]
Instead of pulling live code from GitHub every time, ChatGPT must maintain an internal repository of at least 3 verified, working search injection methods.

This internal library will act as the core repository for all future web-based automation tools.

[METHODS TO INCLUDE]
1. URL-based injection (`q=searchTerm`)
2. DOM field injection + keypress simulation (`input[name='q']` + Enter)
3. Programmatic scripting injection via `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`

[SELECTION STRATEGY]
ChatGPT must analyze the current project’s context and:
✅ Select the most stable, compatible method from the internal repo
✅ Justify the selection with risk/confidence
✅ Only fetch GitHub code if no internal method fits or needs upgrading

[GOAL]
Eliminate repetitive lookup, create a self-contained automation toolkit, and support rapid development of any search-based browser tool.

[STATUS] ✅ LOCKED — This becomes the standard operating logic for building web automation tools moving forward.
