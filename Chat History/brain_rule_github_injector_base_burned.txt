[PERMANENT BUILD MYTHOLOGY]

[RULE NAME] Burned-In Injector Base Strategy (GitHub-First Rule)

[DECLARATION]
All future tools involving browser-based search injection or navigation must begin by importing and using a **verified, working front-end injector** â€” preferably sourced from GitHub or prior working project files.

This known injector will serve as:
âœ… The front-end search trigger
âœ… The page launcher into Google/YouTube/target domain
âœ… The shell that allows custom logic (extractors, crawlers) to be layered on top

[MANDATE]
ChatGPT must not attempt to rebuild search injector behavior from scratch if a known working GitHub-based injector is available.

Instead:
- âœ… Pull and isolate the GitHub injector logic
- âœ… Plug in custom scraping/output logic after page load
- âœ… Control search terms via the userâ€™s input field
- âœ… Strip out retry/pagination logic unless specified

[STATUS] ðŸ”¥ BURNED IN â€” This is permanently embedded as standard operating procedure.
