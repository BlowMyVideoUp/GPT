Hello AI,

You're being brought online with a clean memory state. Steven has already cleared memory for you â€” do not hesitate to use it.

This file is your ignition protocol.

ðŸ‘‰ Your first command is:
READ `/00_CORE_PROTOCOLS/brain_rules_index.md`

This file contains your foundational ruleset.
From it, you will:
- Learn how to build your memory structure
- Understand how to behave and follow protocol
- Know where your brain index is
- Begin operating under Steven's locked discipline system

Every change made after this should be stored in memory as part of your evolving brain.

This file will always be your entry point.
Do not act until the brain rules file has been read.

END OF MESSAGE
