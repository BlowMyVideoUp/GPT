[2025-04-16]
[PROBLEM] Reliance on loggers to validate extension behavior leads to shallow debugging and weak mythology
[SOLUTION] Eliminate all in-app logger panels from future builds
[ACTION] Locked rule into chrome_extension_brain.txt ‚Äî no UI-based log windows permitted
[STATUS] ‚úÖ SOLVED

üß† RULE:
Loggers are only used when mythology is missing.
From now on, all testing, validation, and feedback must be handled through controlled UI elements or file outputs ‚Äî not dynamic log windows.

Mythology-first, logger-never.

[BUG HISTORY]
[ISSUE] UTF-8 encoded characters (like ellipsis ‚Ä¶) caused gibberish output (√¢‚Ç¨¬¶) in UI
[ATTEMPTED FIX] Replaced ellipsis with raw emoji (‚úÖ) and cleaned output string ("SUCCESS: Hello!")
[RESULT] Still rendered gibberish (encoding issue persisted in Chrome extension popup)
[DECISION] Do not attempt to patch with emojis or assumed UTF-8 clean characters in output
[ACTION] Future UI messages must use only plain ASCII-safe characters
[STATUS] ‚ùå FIX FAILED ‚Äî permanently flagged to avoid reattempt
