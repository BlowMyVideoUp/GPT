- Recovery Protocol Reference

Generated by ChatGPT in sync with Steven West‚Äôs command mythology.

[PROBLEM] Reliance on loggers to validate extension behavior leads to shallow debugging and weak mythology
[SOLUTION] Eliminate all in-app logger panels from future builds
[ACTION] Locked rule into chrome_extension_brain.txt ‚Äî no UI-based log windows permitted
[STATUS] ‚úÖ SOLVED

üß† RULE:
Loggers are only used when mythology is missing.
From now on, all testing, validation, and feedback must be handled through controlled UI elements or file outputs ‚Äî not dynamic log windows.

Mythology-first, logger-never.

[BUG HISTORY]
[ISSUE] UTF-8 encoded characters (like ellipsis ‚Ä¶) caused gibberish output (√¢‚Ç¨¬¶) in UI
[ATTEMPTED FIX] Replaced ellipsis with raw emoji (‚úÖ) and cleaned output string ("SUCCESS: Hello!")
[RESULT] Still rendered gibberish (encoding issue persisted in Chrome extension popup)
[DECISION] Do not attempt to patch with emojis or assumed UTF-8 clean characters in output
[ACTION] Future UI messages must use only plain ASCII-safe characters
[STATUS] ‚ùå FIX FAILED ‚Äî permanently flagged to avoid reattempt

[2025-04-16]
[BRAIN RULE] Every time a problem and solution is logged, it must include a classification:

[FIX TYPE]
- ‚úÖ ABSOLUTE: This is the only reliable fix known. All others failed or are unsafe.
- üîÑ VARIABLE: Multiple known ways to fix the issue. Options should be listed for fallback.

[EXAMPLE]
[PROBLEM] Special characters render as gibberish (e.g. √¢‚Ç¨¬¶ instead of ‚Ä¶)
[SOLUTION] Replace innerHTML with textContent
[FIX TYPE] üîÑ VARIABLE ‚Äî other safe fixes include adding UTF-8 <meta> tag, using ASCII, or Unicode escape codes.

[WHY THIS MATTERS]
This helps ChatGPT:
- Know whether it must reuse a specific solution every time
- Or if it's allowed to rotate strategies based on context

[2025-04-16]
[BRAIN RULE] "Update the Brain" is not just about bug fixes ‚Äî it refers to any of the following:

1. [BUG FIX]
   - A known issue was encountered
   - A solution was applied and classified (ABSOLUTE or VARIABLE)
   - Logged for future prevention

2. [TECH IMPROVEMENT]
   - A smarter or cleaner way of doing something was discovered
   - May replace older logic, or add optimization
   - Example: Using .textContent instead of .innerHTML for safety

3. [BEHAVIOR ADJUSTMENT]
   - A habit or methodology that needs to evolve
   - Often about improving the way ChatGPT works with a human dev
   - Example: Don‚Äôt use emojis unless ASCII safe

4. [PATTERN LOCK]
   - A new pattern has emerged (e.g. test one field at a time)
   - Locked into mythology as standard procedure
   - Ensures consistency across builds

[STATUS] ‚úÖ ENFORCED ‚Äî Every time "update the brain" is triggered, it must include a label for which of the 4 categories it applies to.

This allows smarter history, more searchable logs, and a real AI memory trail.
