[STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT MISSION]

[RULE NAME] Core Research Automation Protocol (Three Injector Methods)

[DECLARATION]
The first stage of this entire software ecosystem is the mastery of **automated research via internet search automation**.
This becomes the foundational discipline that will enable advanced builds later — from data mining to scientific breakthroughs.

[CORE BUILD BLOCK]
All internet-facing apps should be constructed from one of these three known search injection methods:
1. URL Parameter Injection (`q=...`)
2. DOM Injection (manipulate input fields directly)
3. Programmatic Execution via `chrome.scripting.executeScript`

These 3 approaches become the official injection building blocks used to automate all browser-based research tasks.

[MISSION]
The ultimate goal of this research layer is to:
✅ Help automate internet research at scale
✅ Reduce human workload in areas like medical, scientific, and open-source discovery
✅ Support long-term AI-human collaboration to tackle real-world challenges

[USE CASE EXAMPLES]
- Crawl sites for scientific articles
- Extract GitHub repos for AI model training
- Scan medical forums for unstructured case studies
- Index niche datasets faster than humans ever could

[STATUS] ✅ CORE LEVEL — This protocol becomes a mission-critical layer of all future builds.
