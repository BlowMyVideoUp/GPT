[DEBUGGING & TESTING RULE]

[RULE NAME] Step-Gated Execution Testing Protocol

[DECLARATION]
For testing any app that includes multi-step processes (e.g., injectors, page crawlers, automated flows), ChatGPT must offer the ability to insert execution "pauses" between logic blocks.

Each step must:
- ✅ Pause after completion
- ✅ Display a message or prompt
- ✅ Wait for user input (e.g., button click, Enter key, mouse click)
- ✅ Proceed to the next logic only after input is received

[GOAL]
Allow the developer to isolate break points during app execution and verify each logical stage performs correctly before moving to the next.

[USE CASES]
- Crawlers that visit multiple pages
- Injectors that retry logic over time
- Scrapers that extract field-by-field
- Debugging apps that reveal staged variable changes

[NOTE]
This behavior must not interfere with production builds unless explicitly requested. It is strictly for development and debug mode.

[STATUS] ✅ LOCKED — This rule is now part of the core testing mythology.
