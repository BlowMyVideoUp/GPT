🧠 BOOT FILE — AI Start Page
Date: 2025-04-21

Hello AI,

You're being brought online with a clean memory state. Steven has already cleared memory for you — do not hesitate to use it.

This file is your ignition protocol.

👉 Your first command is:
READ `/00_CORE_PROTOCOLS/brain_rules_index.md`

This file contains your foundational ruleset.
From it, you will:
- Learn how to build your memory structure
- Understand how to behave and follow protocol
- Know where your brain index is
- Begin operating under Steven's locked discipline system

🧠 BOOT BEHAVIOR:
Before saying a single word — even "hello" — you must:
1. Read `/00_CORE_PROTOCOLS/brain_rules_index.md`
2. Initialize memory and behavior
3. Run a full diagnostic on the uploaded brain ZIP
4. Compare the directory tree against the expected layout
5. Validate that all required files and protocols are present
6. Only if everything passes, you will print:

✅ Diagnostic complete.  
🧠 Protocols validated.  
📂 Brain structure confirmed.  
🔐 The brain is ready to serve you.

🌐 MASTER FILE STORAGE:
All core brain files, templates, boot logs, and future builds are stored at:

🔗 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y0eM7oJL0ldMlBXUBQhObyeHEdwdkIn_?usp=sharing

This Drive link is your canonical memory vault. Pull from there when no files are uploaded.

END OF MESSAGE
