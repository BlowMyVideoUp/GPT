                                      Problem                                                                                                   Cause                                                                                                                 Solution      Type
0                    No Start Button Assigned  Failure to assign an initial start trigger in the UI results in the app not functioning or responding.                                               Always assign at least one button with an `onclick` event and a unique ID.  Absolute
1           UI Structure Breaks After Changes                                        Uncontrolled template adjustments cause core layout to collapse.  1. Lock the base UI template before logic injection. 2. Fork UI into modular layouts that can be replaced individually.      Fork
2              Extensions Leave Ghost Windows                               Persistent popups or heartbeat loops arenâ€™t being shut down on uninstall.                            Implement kill-switch listeners (`chrome.runtime.onSuspend`) and cleanups in `background.js`.  Absolute
3                  Template Changes Mid-Build                                AI modifies base template unintentionally during iterative logic builds.                                1. Freeze template as locked layer before logic. 2. Use version control per visual layer.      Fork
4             Buttons Not Assigned Unique IDs                            Multiple buttons without unique `id` attributes break targeting and styling.                                                     Enforce naming rules and auto-ID generator during UI scaffold phase.  Absolute
5                    Failed Download Handling                                  Download links (e.g. zip files) fail silently or repeat unnecessarily.                                       Log all previous downloads in localStorage or a log.txt file, and skip duplicates.  Absolute
6         File Size Not Matching Prior Builds      File size of output differs from expected, potentially indicating missing assets or bloated logic.                                                    Include file size tracking and comparison in final validation report.  Absolute
7           Duplicate Downloads Not Prevented                               Lack of state tracking causes same files to be downloaded multiple times.                                            Log all previous download links and filenames, and compare before each fetch.  Absolute
8                     Debugger Used Too Early                        AI attempts to debug when the app is still fundamentally flawed or UI is broken.                                                Only activate debugger as a last resort, otherwise start new clean build.  Absolute
9         Validation Report Missing File List                                                  Incomplete report generation, skipping file inventory.                                                    Ensure validation report includes full file list, with name and size.  Absolute
10             Ghost Template Elements Remain                                         Old UI elements remain from previous builds, polluting new UIs.                                                     Purge UI cache and re-render template cleanly with version flagging.  Absolute
11            Logic Injected into Unstable UI                                 Logic is added before template structure is finalized, causing crashes.                                                                   Lock down the base UI template before injecting logic.  Absolute
12             Extension Popup Fails to Close                                                   Missing or faulty close event handler or tab cleanup.                                                                            Add window/tab close events to popup scripts.  Absolute
13                Button Layout Not Preserved                                            Layout shifts between builds due to style or DOM reordering.                                                        Snapshot button layout positions and reuse fixed grid or flexbox.  Absolute
14                     Missing Onclick Events                                 Buttons are created without interaction handlers, rendering them inert.                                         Verify each button has an assigned function and event binding during validation.  Absolute
15            Old Files Persist After Rebuild                      Rebuilds do not clean old folders or cache, leading to false positives in testing.                                                             Purge build directory and cache before initiating new build.  Absolute
16        Popup Doesn't Trigger on Icon Click                                           Missing default_popup property in manifest or incorrect path.                                                                Ensure `default_popup` is set correctly in manifest.json.  Absolute
17                Overlapping Logic Functions                       Multiple logic blocks interfere due to global scope or duplicate event listeners.                                                         Isolate logic per component and clean event listeners on reload.  Absolute
18  Inconsistent File Structure Across Builds                               Different builds place files in different folder paths, breaking imports.                                                                       Standardize file structure and enforce path rules.  Absolute
19               UI Buttons Render Off-Screen                                                            Lack of scaling logic or viewport awareness.                                                    Use CSS viewport units or clamp layout dimensions with media queries.  Absolute
20            Stale background.js Code Reused                                     Background logic not refreshed due to cache or unchanged filenames.                                                    Always bump version or invalidate cache on background script updates.  Absolute
21    Logic Dependent on Async DOM That Fails                                                         DOM elements not available when logic executes.                                                     Wrap DOM-dependent logic in `DOMContentLoaded` or mutation observer.  Absolute
22            CSS Fails to Load in Production                                           Missing link, bad path, or unscoped styles in minified build.                                               Verify CSS inclusion in manifest and use relative paths with version hash.  Absolute
23                  Reload Breaks Popup State                                                              State not persisted between popup reloads.                                                 Store state in `chrome.storage` or `localStorage` and rehydrate on load.  Absolute
24              Runtime Messages Not Received                                              Messaging listener not registered or disconnected context.                                                     Confirm `chrome.runtime.onMessage` is declared in all live contexts.  Absolute
