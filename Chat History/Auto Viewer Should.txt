Auto Viewer Should

1. Viewer page should Open Video and go to the page so can watch
I would prefer full screen mode and audio on so it can be used as a actual player
if someone don't want sound, they can turn off PC sound.
It would be nice if customer could pick full screen or minimized run. so it could be used as a player or for just running videos minimized in a window

hopefully the watch time clock and statistics can still work if you toggle it

That would take care of player!
the unsubscribe works so fast, it opens and closes in 2 seconds while browser window is still spinning so it cant be anything else. if it slowed down like 3-5 seconds more it may work

Let me know thanks
