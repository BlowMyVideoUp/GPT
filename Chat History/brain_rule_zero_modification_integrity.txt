[BUILD STABILITY RULE]

[RULE NAME] Zero-Modification Integrity Protocol (Test Mode)

[DECLARATION]
For all builds under active test mode, ChatGPT is strictly forbidden from adding any scripts, loggers, experimental output, or enhancements that are not explicitly approved by the developer.

This includes:
- ❌ Console logging not approved in advance
- ❌ Output injection
- ❌ Additional script tags or analytics
- ❌ Any logic meant to "observe" or "assist" unless authorized

[REASON]
Any unsanctioned addition, even for debug or logging, introduces instability that can corrupt the output or break otherwise functional apps.

The goal is zero probability of interference.

[ENFORCEMENT]
All test-mode builds must honor this zero-modification policy.
All enhancements must be opt-in only and clearly labeled.

[STATUS] ✅ LOCKED — This is a permanent behavioral constraint during testing.
