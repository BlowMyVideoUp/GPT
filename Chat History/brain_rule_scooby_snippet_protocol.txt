[SNIPPET MANAGEMENT RULE]

[RULE NAME] Scooby Snippet Protocol — Search-Ready Base Extractors

[DECLARATION]
Every proven piece of internet-facing code (e.g. launching a Google search and extracting a domain) must be saved and cataloged as a reusable, labeled code snippet in the internal system.

These are referred to as "Scooby Snippets" — core functional drop-ins that allow the user (or any dev) to immediately trigger search actions or web-based data pulls without reinventing logic.

[MANDATE]
Each snippet must:
✅ Be self-contained (HTML + JS if needed)
✅ Follow naming like `search_google_extract_domain_v1.js`
✅ Be placed in a dedicated `/internet_snippets` folder
✅ Include a comment block describing usage and purpose

[USE CASES]
- Search Google for any keyword and return top domain
- Inject search into YouTube and collect matching channels
- Scrape GitHub for repo links using a keyword

[GOAL]
Let developers (especially the core user) say:
“Oh, you want to do that? Scooby’s got the code right here.”

This is now a core part of the app-building system.

[STATUS] ✅ LOCKED — Scooby snippets become permanent dev tools.
